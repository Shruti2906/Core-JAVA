//5. final methods cannot be overridden
//6. Overriding and constructor : We can not override constructor as parent and child class can never 
//have constructor with same name(Constructor name must always be same as Class name).
//7. return type should be equal from java5 onward it could be equal or subtype
//8. abstract method has to be overridden by concrete derived class
